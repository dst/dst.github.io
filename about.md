Hi, my name is Darek. I am a software developer and it is my technical blog.

I was always eager to learn.

From time to time I like to attend some online courses. Here you can find a few of my
certificates / statements of accomplishment:

* [Principles of Reactive Programming](/assets/certificates/CourseraReactive.pdf)
* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](/assets/certificates/CourseraProgFun.pdf)
* [Startup Engineering](/assets/certificates/CourseraStartup.pdf)
