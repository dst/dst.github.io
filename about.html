## About

I graduated from Computer Science at University of Warsaw and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I was also a PhD student at
University of Warsaw. My specialization were Distributed Systems and High-Performance Distributed Computing accordingly.
I had a scholarship for education achievements each year. Nevertheless, studying was not enough
for me - I always wanted to challenge with real problems, so I started working during the third year of my studies
and continued it during all my further education.

I'm not strongly tied to any technology. In fact, I like a diversity. I worked in over a dozen of projects for various
industries(financial, military, telecom, medical, publishing house, retail) using diverse technologies
(Java, Groovy, C/C++, C\#, Python, Bash, JavaScript, etc.).

I'm enthusiast of clean code, Test-Driven-Development and microservices approach, a strong believer in CI/CD,
automating and removing manual tasks.

I have always a huge smile on my face when I can play with:

* distributed systems
* multithreading applications
* network programming

I work only for companies with a strong engineering culture. I can help you to build distributed systems or migrate
from monolith to microservice architecture.

It's very important for me to always increase my skills, so from time to time I like to attend some online courses.
Here you can find a few of my certificates:
